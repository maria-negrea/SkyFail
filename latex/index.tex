This project represents a scene involving the Orion constellation during the timelapse of a night.

We are using the Glut Library for accesing drawing methods in Open\+G\+L.

In order to build this project under Windows, one must use the Visual Studio suite (v.\+2008 recommended). To run it under Linux (tested on Ubuntu), we provided a Make file runnable using {\itshape make} command.
